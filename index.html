  "Help these boys build a nation their own. Ransack the histories for clues to their past. Plunder the literatures for words they can speak. And should you encounter an ancient tribe whose customs, however dimly, cast light on their hearts, tell them that tale; and you shall name the unspeakable names of your kind, and in that naming, in each such telling, they will falter a step to the light.<br>
  For only with pride may a man prosper. With pride, all things follow. Without he have pride he is a shadowy skulk whose season is night."<br>
    <strong> - Jamie O'Neill, At Swim, Two Boys"<br></strong>
